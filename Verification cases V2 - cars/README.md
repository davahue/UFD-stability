# Verification cases
This folder includes two main codes:
- Onset_test_Q7.py provides the calculation of the stability curves (flotation, sliding, toppling) for one vehicle (Audi Q7).
- Onset_test_verification_visualization.py provides the plotting for all data generated from stability calculations for the verification case cars.

An additional file, faux.py provides auxiliary functions.
