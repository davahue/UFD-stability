# UFD-stability
This repository includes codes allowing the stability determination for different categories of Urban Flood Drifters (UFDs). It also includes the processed results for easier determination of the inception of movement.

The UFD subcategories considered are those of Table 2 of: Bayon, Valero and Franca (2023):
|                 | Category    | ID | Subcategory       |
|-----------------|-------------|----|-------------------|
| **Typified UFDs** |             | V1 | Two-wheelers      |
| (UFD-V)         | Vehicles    | V2 | Cars              |
|                 |             | V3 | Vans              |
|                 |             | V4 | Caravans & RVs    |
|                 |             | V5 | Large heavy vehicles |
|                 |             | F1 | Urban fixtures    |
| (UFD-F)         | Furniture   | F2 | Household equipment |
| **Heterog. UFDs** | (UFD-H)    | DC | Construction      |
|                 |             | DM | Metal             |
|                 |             | DP | Plastic           |
|                 |             | DW | Wood              |
