**Instructions**

This folder contains the following codes:
1. Codes to calculate the stability of different types of vehicles (UFD-V1 to UFD-V5) under flood conditions.
2. Code to put all those results together and make a joint plot.

To run (1.), choose a type of vehicle and unzip the directory. Within, you will find the corresponding code: V2_probabilistic_curve.py
Run this code, which will read the input characteristics from the "V2-input" folder and will save all results into "V2-results".
If you want to use these results into the joint figure, then you must copy all the resutls from "V2-results" to "V2-results-1000", since it is the latter that code (2.) "Complete_plot_stability_vehicles_multifigure.py" is reading.
